# 30 Day Chart Challenge

## Day 1: Part-to-whole

A waffle chart of squares with 10 rows and 42 columns showing the breakdown of number of days taken to lose 61lbs of weight in my weight loss journey over the past 15 months. I went from 253lb to 192lb. Each group of tens is a category i.e. the 190lb's is a category, the 200lb's is a category and so on and so forth. Each box represents 1 day spent in that weight group (a.k.a. category). The plot is able to show that it becomes progressively harder to lose weight, for example while I was in the 240s for only 18 days, I was in the 230s for almost double that time and then same for the 220s. The data is here https://github.com/aarora79/30DayChartChallenge/blob/main/01-part-to-whole/bodyweight.csv.

## Day 2: Pictogram

A pictogram for a workout I did one weekend. Made using highcharter package and icons found on the web. Each drawing of the icon equals one rep of the exercise. There were four exercises: bodyrows, burpees, pushpresses and sprints. The data is here https://github.com/aarora79/30DayChartChallenge/blob/main/02-pictogram/workout.csv.

## Day 3: Historical

A historical chart showing how the names gaining popularity in the decade of [2010, 2020)have fared historically. We determine the top 10 male and female names and draw a timeseries chart of how popular these names have been historically since the 1910s. The data for this analysis is available in BigQuery public dataset collection (usa_names) and is not being checked in as part of this repo. We find that same of the names gaining fastest in popularity were also popular in the early 1900s. Names such as EVelyn and Charlotte for females and Henry and Leo are back in favor. A name that stands out is 'Liam' for its very distinct rise (that still continues) since the 1990s.

## Day 4: Magical

A couple of charts about the TV Series "Just Add Magic". The wordcloud shows it is about three friends who cook spells from their grandma's cookbook. The network graph shows summarizes the season using bigrams from episode summaries. Season 1 and 3 have little in common except for "Saffron Falls" the place where the show takes place, Season 2 and 3 have the common theme of the girls cooking spells.

## Day 5: Slope

A slope chart showing body composition changes (weight, lean mass, BMI) with diet and exercise of a 14 month period. More such charts and data in my book \"Blueberries In My Salad: My Journey Towards Fitness & Strength\" (Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Blueberries-My-Salad-Journey-Strength-ebook/dp/B08KPMGT4W, LeanPub: https://leanpub.com/blueberries-in-my-salad/c/4Pe65eVXFLx3). Please show some love to a first time author :-).

## Day 6: Experimental

Experimented with a bullet chart for the first time (thank you: https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-11-29-bullet-chart-variants-in-r/). The chart shows my progress towards my deadlift target (what it does not show: took 15 months to get to a 315lb deadlift).

## Day 7: Physical

What is more physical than lifting 300lb off the ground or carrying 250lb for 30 steps? Here is a chart showing the distribution of the pounds I deadlifted over the past 14 months. Made using the wonderful <a href=https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/gallery.html>ggridges</a> package.

## Day 8: Animals

Do the last 5 letters of a dinosaur species name give a clue about their diet? This simple bar chart faceted by the suffix helps answer this question. Seems like the most common suffix "sauras" has the most diverse diet as a species, followed by raptor's and pteryx'es.

## Day 9: Statistics

An attempt to model number of days spend at each weight during my weight loss journey. Start with visualizing the the data (number of days spent at each weight) using histogram, density plot and empirical CDF and then observe that the distribution looks like a long tailed distribution. Model the distribution using the \"[fitdistrplus](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fitdistrplus/vignettes/paper2JSS.pdf)\" package as a Weibull, Gamma and Log Normal distribution. Plot the goodness of fit plots. Seems like the Log Normal fits the empirical distribution the best as observed from the CDF plots. For a change, plot the charts in base R rather than ggplot2.

## Day 10: Abstract

Using a t-SNE plot to see if it can separate out classes in a high dimensional imbalanced dataset. The dataset used here contains anonymized credit card transactions made over 2 days in September 2013 by European cardholders, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. It is available as part of the BigQuery public datasets, please see bigquery-public-data:ml_datasets.ulb_fraud_detection. 

The closeness of the points representing the fraud transactions show how t-SNE can reveal structures in high dimensional data!

Data originally from: Andrea Dal Pozzolo, Olivier Caelen, Reid A. Johnson and Gianluca Bontempi. Calibrating Probability with Undersampling for Unbalanced Classification. In Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining (CIDM), IEEE, 2015.

## Day 11: Circular

Which licenses are most commonly used for which languages in open source repositories in GitHub? We try to find the answer by looking at the top 10 languages corresponding to the top 5 open source licenses used in GitHub. C/C++ find a place in the top 10 list for all licenses except for MIT, and also MIT seems to be the license of choice for most of the open source repositories with Javascript, CSS, HTML and other web programming languages forming the bulk of the repos.

## Day 12: Strips

Visualizing the number of Starbucks stores per city across the top 10 countries with the most Starbucks stores (as of 2017) using a strip plot. Each point represents a city and the x-axis represents number of stores in a city. The U.S. has the most Starbucks stores by a long margin and also the most cities with more than 25 stores per city. Other than the Canada, Mexico and the U.K. all other countries are in Asia, nothing in Europe (this data is from an [old dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrismeller/StarbucksLocations/master/stores.csv)).

## Day 13: Correlation

Higher the prevalence of obesity in a population, lower the life expectancy. Each point in this chart represents a U.S, county, data from [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)](http://www.healthdata.org/), [this link](http://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/data_for_download/alcohol_life_expect/IHME_county_data_LifeExpectancy_Obesity_PhysicalActivity_NATIONAL.xlsx). A simple scatter plot with trend line is able to show the clear negative correlation.

## Day 14: Space

Exploring the Exoplanets. There are lots of them! Most of the Exoplanets are within 2500 parsec distance of the sun and surface temperature less than 2000 Kelvin. The largest Exoplanet **KOI-3617 b** is far away and hot, the smallest Exoplanet **KOI-2867 c** is close(er) and cool(er).

## Day 15: Trees

Classify wheat kernels using a decision tree. A decision tree chart that using only two features i.e. area and length of the kernel groove we can achieve pretty good classification. A treemap is used to plot the decision boundary of a classifier built using these two features.
