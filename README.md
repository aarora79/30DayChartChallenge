# 30 Day Chart Challenge

## Day 1: Part-to-whole

A waffle chart of squares with 10 rows and 42 columns showing the breakdown of number of days taken to lose 61lbs of weight in my weight loss journey over the past 15 months. I went from 253lb to 192lb. Each group of tens is a category i.e. the 190lb's is a category, the 200lb's is a category and so on and so forth. Each box represents 1 day spent in that weight group (a.k.a. category). The plot is able to show that it becomes progressively harder to lose weight, for example while I was in the 240s for only 18 days, I was in the 230s for almost double that time and then same for the 220s. The data is here https://github.com/aarora79/30DayChartChallenge/blob/main/01-part-to-whole/bodyweight.csv.

## Day 2: Pictogram

A pictogram for a workout I did one weekend. Made using highcharter package and icons found on the web. Each drawing of the icon equals one rep of the exercise. There were four exercises: bodyrows, burpees, pushpresses and sprints. The data is here https://github.com/aarora79/30DayChartChallenge/blob/main/02-pictogram/workout.csv.

## Day 3: Historical

A historical chart showing how the names gaining popularity in the decade of [2010, 2020)have fared historically. We determine the top 10 male and female names and draw a timeseries chart of how popular these names have been historically since the 1910s. The data for this analysis is available in BigQuery public dataset collection (usa_names) and is not being checked in as part of this repo. We find that same of the names gaining fastest in popularity were also popular in the early 1900s. Names such as EVelyn and Charlotte for females and Henry and Leo are back in favor. A name that stands out is 'Liam' for its very distinct rise (that still continues) since the 1990s.

## Day 4: Magical

A couple of charts about the TV Series "Just Add Magic". The wordcloud shows it is about three friends who cook spells from their grandma's cookbook. The network graph shows summarizes the season using bigrams from episode summaries. Season 1 and 3 have little in common except for "Saffron Falls" the place where the show takes place, Season 2 and 3 have the common theme of the girls cooking spells.
