# 30 Day Chart Challenge

## Day 1: Part-to-whole

A waffle chart of squares with 10 rows and 42 columns showing the breakdown of number of days taken to lose 61lbs of weight in my weight loss journey over the past 15 months. I went from 253lb to 192lb. Each group of tens is a category i.e. the 190lb's is a category, the 200lb's is a category and so on and so forth. Each box represents 1 day spent in that weight group (a.k.a. category). The plot is able to show that it becomes progressively harder to lose weight, for example while I was in the 240s for only 18 days, I was in the 230s for almost double that time and then same for the 220s. The data is here https://github.com/aarora79/30DayChartChallenge/blob/main/01-part-to-whole/bodyweight.csv.

## Day 1: Pictogram

A pictogram for a workout I did one weekend. Made using highcharter package and icons found on the web. Each drawing of the icon equals one rep of the exercise. There were four exercises: bodyrows, burpees, pushpresses and sprints. The data is here https://github.com/aarora79/30DayChartChallenge/blob/main/02-pictogram/workout.csv.
